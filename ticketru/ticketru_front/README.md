# UniPay
 The Git repository for this project will contain all the necessary files and folders for the development of the web application. It will have a main branch where the stable version of the application will reside, and feature branches will be created for each new feature or bug fix. The repository will utilize React and React Bootstrap as the primary frameworks for building the application's user interface. Additionally, Bootstrap 5 will be used for styling and layout purposes.  The repository will also include JavaScript and possibly TypeScript for the development of the application's logic and functionality. To ensure code quality and consistency, ESlint will be implemented for code analysis and Prettier for code formatting. The Git repository will be hosted on a platform like GitHub or Bitbucket, allowing for easy collaboration among team members and the ability to track changes and version history.
